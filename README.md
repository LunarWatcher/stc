# stc

Header-only utilities for C++20\* and up. Name inspired by [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) (in part so I can have `stb`, `stc`, and `std` in some of my projects :) )

<sub>\*: Subject to change in the future</sub>

stc has documentation generated by doxygen. An online version is available [on GitHub pages](https://lunarwatcher.github.io/stc/). 

For information about the included features, see the doxygen docs, or the [docs folder](docs/README.md).
