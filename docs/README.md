# Docs

This folder contains the documentation for the various files.

Note that in files with functions, certain signatures may have been simplified where I believe it's irrelevant to include the entire signature. At the time of writing, this notably includes `const type&` simplified to `type`, because, agaik, I don't believe it's relevant to the usage of the method. See the original code for an exact signature.

The filenames correspond to the equivalent header; This means `Environment.md` contains the docs for `Environment.hpp`.
